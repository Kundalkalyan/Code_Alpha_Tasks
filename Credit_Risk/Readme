## 💳 Credit Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project builds a Credit Risk Prediction System that classifies whether a loan applicant is likely to:

✅ Low Risk (Will Repay Loan)

❌ High Risk (May Default)

The goal is to help financial institutions make data-driven decisions while approving loans.

This project demonstrates:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Model training

Model evaluation

Model saving for deployment

🧠 Problem Statement (Beginner Friendly)

Banks receive thousands of loan applications.
Not every applicant repays the loan.

Using historical customer data, we train a Machine Learning model to predict:

“Is this customer likely to default?”

This helps reduce financial losses.

⚙️ Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection

Dataset contains customer details such as:

Age

Income

Loan amount

Credit history

Employment status

Other financial indicators

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling

Train-Test split

3️⃣ Model Training

Models used:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest Classifier

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics used:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

5️⃣ Model Saving

The trained model is saved using:

import joblib
joblib.dump(model, "credit_model.pkl")

This allows future deployment without retraining.
